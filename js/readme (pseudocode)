How to win:
Players are competing with each other on who will first connect 4 of their assigned color pieces in a line either:
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

How to play: playGame()
player 1 starts by selecting a column to place their first game piece
player 2 goes after: selects a column to add their game piece
<!--  -->

once a column is selected, that player's game piece will "drop" into the bottom row of the gameboard (row 1 of 6) by default
-if player2 decides to add their game piece to the same column as player1, then player2's game piece will be added in the next row (row 2 of 6) above the default row.

each row will be filled up from bottom to top as each player fill ups the gameboard

Turns():
